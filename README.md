# XpressAI

XpressAI is an advanced machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) project designed to analyze and predict user behavior, themes, and personalities based on social media datasets (e.g., X posts). It also includes features to generate engaging content and simulate interactions with like-minded individuals.

---

## Features

- **Data Collection**: Scrape and preprocess datasets from X (formerly Twitter) or other social media platforms.
- **Personality Prediction**: Analyze user posts to predict personality traits using machine learning models.
- **Theme Prediction**: Identify upcoming themes or trends based on user activity.
- **Content Generation**: Generate posts tailored to specific audiences using generative AI models.
- **Bot Interaction**: Simulate interactions with like-minded individuals to attract engagement.
- **Custom Responses**: Centralized response handling for APIs with structured error and success messages.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `transformers` (Hugging Face) for NLP and model fine-tuning.
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning.
  - `spaCy` and `NLTK` for text preprocessing.
- **Frameworks**:
  - Django and Django REST Framework for backend APIs.
  - Flask or FastAPI for lightweight API deployment.
- **Database**: PostgreSQL or MongoDB for storing datasets and results.
- **Deployment**: Docker for containerization.
